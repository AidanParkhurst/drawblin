<h3><i>A silly, social drawing game</i></h3>
<p>Drawblins is a multiplayer, <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> browser game, where players control a little goblin character that can traverse the whole screen. Using the mouse, players can draw anywhere in the radius around their goblin. There's also a little chat to socialize with other players.</p>
<p>No account is required, but creating an account (auth powered by <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>) allows players to set a custom name, and host private games in their "house". (A private URL)</p>
<p>The game is totally free to play and ad free, but we offer small cosmetic purchases (payments managed through <a href="stripe.com">Stripe</a>) for players to make their goblin look even cooler, and support the costs of keeping the game alive!</p>
<p>Lastly, the game is 100% open source! All of the code (both front and backend) is here, and in fact the frontend is hosted through github pages (the backend is an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud VPS</a>). I'm happy for other people to use this project, but do NOT impersonate Drawblins publicly, and do NOT use any of the art/assets for commercial purposes.</p>
